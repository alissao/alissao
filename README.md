## Hi there

I'm a brazilian Software Developer and Engineer, focused on Back-end with Java and everything JVM related.
I know some React for front-end too, but my passion is in Software Performance (throughput, concurrency, threads, etc.) and Automation.

### Currently working on:
  - My own 12 factor app, called [Cucina](https://github.com/alissao/cucina) (it means kitchen in Italian)
  - A [personal project](https://github.com/alissao/SheetsAutomation) to automate time consuming responsibilities with Google Sheets

### Fun facts about me:
In my free time i like to study new languages, like Spanish, Italian and French.
And i also try to play guitar.
In software, above all, i like things that simply works.
